# gologger

My small logger library. This is not meant to be used by anyone, I just kept copy pasting this in my projects and thought it is time to have it versioned as dependency. 

It has a global extensible logger, featuring 2 extensions:

- `console`, basically just standard slog
- `loki`, pushing logs in batches to a Loki instance# gologger
